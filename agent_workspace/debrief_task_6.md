## Debrief for Task 6

- Task Completed: Task 6: CostMonitor (Billing Polling) (branch `feature/cost-monitor`)
- Summary of Changes: Implemented periodic cost polling for OpenAI and Gemini, displaying cost info in the Streamlit sidebar. Refactored cost_monitor to require explicit start_polling() for testability, eliminating background thread warnings in tests.
- Key Files Modified/Created: src/shared/cost_monitor.py, src/interfaces/gui.py, tests/unit/test_cost_monitor.py
- Commit SHA: cd5b5a5
- PR Link: https://github.com/ianlucas1/agent_system/pull/23
- Tag (if applicable): N/A
- Current Git Status: main branch up to date, feature branch deleted
- Next Task Information: Proceed to Task 7 (Streamlit GUI Redesign - Dark Theme)
- Potential Issues or Notes for Next Agent: If you add new background threads, prefer explicit start functions for testability. See cost_monitor.py for pattern.
