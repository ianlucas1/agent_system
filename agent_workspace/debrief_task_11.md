## Debrief for Task 11

- Task Completed: Task 11: Integrate Chroma Vector Memory (branch `feature/memory-chroma`)
- Summary of Changes: Added a Chroma-backed long-term memory tool (`src/tools/memory.py`); implemented `/remember` and `/recall` command parsing & routing in `src/handlers/command.py`; updated `requirements.txt` (added `chromadb`); created unit tests (`tests/unit/test_memory_tool.py`) and adjusted `tests/unit/test_cost_monitor.py`; integrated memory tool with `ToolRegistry`; fixed import paths in `src/interfaces/app.py`; CI & linters pass.
- Key Files Modified/Created: `requirements.txt`, `src/tools/memory.py`, `src/handlers/command.py`, `tests/unit/test_memory_tool.py`, `tests/unit/test_cost_monitor.py`, `src/interfaces/app.py`, plus docs and helper files.
