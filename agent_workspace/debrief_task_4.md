## Debrief for Task 4

- Task Completed: Task 4: Implement ChatHistoryManager (branch `feature/persistent-history`)
- Summary of Changes: Implemented persistent chat history using a new `history.py` module. Modified `ChatSession.process_user_message` to save user and agent messages, and updated the Streamlit GUI to load history on startup and include a clear chat button. Added unit tests for the history module and fixed a failing test related to pending write handling.
