# Multi-Agent Chatbot GUI (SOP-based multi-agent coordination)

Welcome to the **agent_system** documentation site.

This project is an interactive Streamlit application for orchestrating **multiple cooperative LLM agents**. It features a structured Planner â†’ Coder â†’ QualityGate â†’ Reviewer workflow (SOP coordination), a shared, file-locked **ContextBus** (MCP-lite memory), an extensible **ToolRegistry** (file ops, shell, git/gh, memory, workflow, etc.), built-in observability (Prometheus toggle, `/metrics`), strict quality gates (Ruff, pytest, MyPy/Bandit for touched files, auto QA for code-generating agents), and live documentation (MkDocs GH-Pages). The GUI serves as the central cockpit for these operations.

Recent updates include long-term vector memory, a headless web browser, a SQL analytics engine, task scheduling, and GUI automation toolsâ€”extending agent capabilities while keeping the system lean.
