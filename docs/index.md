# agent_system

Welcome to the **agent_system** documentation site.

This project seeds an autonomous software-development agent that can plan, code, and self-improve through iterative feedback loops.  The long-term goal is a production-grade Ethereum valuation framework powered by rigorous data analysis and research.
