# API Reference

This page provides a reference for the public API of the agent_system project, focusing on the available Tools.

(This section will be populated with API documentation for the public `Tool` classes, either generated automatically using a tool like `mkdocstrings` with a Python handler, or manually created stubs. It should include brief descriptions and method signatures.)
