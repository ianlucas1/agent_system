"""tools.registry
Provides a simple global registry for tool instances so that they can be discovered
and reused across the application without creating tight coupling between
components.  Tools are stored by a lowercase string key and can be retrieved by
other parts of the system (e.g., ChatSession) when needed.

This initial implementation keeps the public surface minimal â€“ just enough for
`ShellCommandTool` (and any future tools) to self-register.  It can be expanded
later to support namespacing, dynamic loading, or per-session overrides.
