# Contributing to **agent_system**

Thank-you for helping improve this project!  Below is a concise, repeatable workflow that keeps the repository healthy and avoids the "untracked files" issue we occasionally hit.

ðŸ‘‰  For the philosophy behind these gates (and how we handle legacy Bandit/MyPy
    findings) see `docs/quality_policy.md`.

## 1  Local Development Loop

```bash
# Sync and create a topic branch
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main

git checkout -b feat/<topic>

# Make your changesâ€¦
#    â€¢ Write code
#    â€¢ Add / update tests
#    â€¢ Update docs

# Static style / linting â€“ must pass
ruff check .

# Tests & coverage â€“ must pass
pytest -q          # coverage gate via pytest.ini

# Static typing â€“ **non-blocking in CI** for now but please fix errors locally
mypy src || true   # remove `|| true` once codebase is type-clean

# Security scan â€“ advisory
bandit -q -r src

# Ensure package is installed in editable mode once per clone
pip install -e .

# Stage *everything* (tracked & untracked) so nothing is missed
# The -A flag catches new files you created.
git add -A

# Commit and push
git commit -m "<type>: <concise summary>"
git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

---
## 2  Create a Pull Request (GitHub CLI)

```bash
# Draft PR â€“ auto-fills title & body from your commit history
gh pr create --base main --head $(git branch --show-current) --draft --fill

# When ready for review
gh pr ready <number>

# Check CI status â€“ wait until all checks are green (âœ”)
gh pr checks <number> --watch

# Merge **only after CI passes** (also deletes remote & local branch)
printf "y\n" | gh pr merge <number> --merge --delete-branch

# Post-merge tidy-up
#   â€¢ Switch back to main and pull latest
#   â€¢ Delete the now-merged feature branch locally if it was **not** auto-deleted

git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git branch -d feat/<topic>
```
