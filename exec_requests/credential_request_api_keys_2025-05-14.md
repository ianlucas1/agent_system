## Credential Request: API Keys

Please provide the following API keys by creating a `.env` file in the project root (`/Users/ianlucas/agent_system/.env`) with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
# ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="your_etherscan_api_key_here" # (Optional, for later data gathering)
# ALCHEMY_API_KEY="your_alchemy_api_key_here"     # (Optional, for robust Ethereum node access)
```

**Rationale:**

*   **OPENAI_API_KEY:** Essential for the agent to use OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) for planning, coding, and research tasks as outlined in the toolchain discovery report.
*   **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY (Optional):** Will be useful for fetching transaction data, contract ABIs, etc., more reliably than public endpoints during Phase 3 (Data Collection).
*   **ALCHEMY_API_KEY (Optional):** Provides robust and reliable access to an Ethereum node, which is more scalable than public nodes, for Phases 2 and 3.

**Action for CEO:**

1.  Obtain the necessary API keys from the respective services (OpenAI, Etherscan, Alchemy).
2.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the `agent_system` repository.
3.  Add the keys to the `.env` file in the format specified above.
4.  Ensure this `.env` file is **not** committed to Git (it should be added to `.gitignore` if a global gitignore is not already handling it).

**If these cannot be provided, the agent's capabilities, particularly in core system generation and data collection, will be significantly limited.**
